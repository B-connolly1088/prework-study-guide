# <Prework Study Guide for Coding Bootcamp>

## Description

The purpose of this webpage is to provide a study guide for the foundations of this bootcamp. This study guide was created to prepare for and get a chance to see code in real life prior to bootcamp. This study guide effectively shows what was covered in prework. Having created this study guide I was able to get a basic understanding of lower level coding that will provide a foundation to build on to achieve a career in tech.
